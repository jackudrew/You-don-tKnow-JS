/*
JavaScript has built-in types for each these so-called primitive types:
    1) When you need to do math, you want a number
    2) When you need to print a value on the screen, you need a string (one or more characters, words, or sentences).
    3) When you need to make a decision in your program, you need a boolean(true or false)

Values that are included directly in the source code are called literals.
String literals are surrounded by double quotes ("...") or single quotes ('...').
The only difference behind this is stylistic preference.

/*
For all string/number/boolean value types, it's common for programming languages to provide arrays, objects, functions, and more.

// Converting between types.

// If you need to print it on the screen, you need to convert the value to a string, and in JavaScript this conversion is called "coercion"
